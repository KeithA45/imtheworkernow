"Emu!"

"Yeah?"

"Patch up this prisoner, will you?"

"Can't."

". . . Why not?"

"Zoya's doing it."

". . . Oooookay. Zoya! Zoya! ZOYA!"

"CHEF, WHAT'S UP?"

"DON'T TEND THE PRISONER."

"WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YA. I'M BY THE GENERATORS."

"DON'T. TEND. THE. PRISONER."

"OKAY, BOSS!"

"Alright. Emu!"

"Yeah?"

"*Now* you can patch up this prisoner."

"Nope."

"Why not now?"

"I'm not a doctor."

"Okay. Alright. Emu? You're a doctor now."

"Cool."

"Patch up this prisoner."

"You got it."

"Great. Fine. Black, you patch up the other prisoner."

"Ooh, I'd love to, but I can't."

"Why not?!"

"Zoya's doin' it."

Chef is hiding in his room.

The final straw was: Talked to fellow colonists

You know that whole "prioritize work" mechanic?

You know how there's a lot of things that can prevent prioritizing work, and you have to go fix that thing, then bring up the popup again? And if you just needed someone to haul an item, but they didn't have hauling active, you have to turn it on, then get them to haul the item, then turn it off again, and it's just a big pain.

I don't like big pains.

If another colonist is already doing the job, it'll now interrupt them and assign the job to the desired colonist. If the desired colonist doesn't have the right job assigned, that's OK, they'll go do the job anyway.

This is very convenient when you're trying to assign quick work to a bunch of colonists, like "build a really important structure" or "haul some stuff" or "butcher a corpse, I don't care if you're bad at it, just get it done right now."

Caveats:

This won't let you assign jobs if the pawn is incapable of that work - it's meant as a convenience feature, nothing else. It doesn't seem to work well for mining (future updates may fix this.) It is *by far* the most finicky and complicated thing I've written; it may be buggy. It probably is.

Does not require a new save game - this can be transparently added and removed from any savegame you already have.
